# 3D Model Library contracts

Moved verbatim out of `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-02 to keep the per-session context budget down. The enforced contract lives in `.claude/rules/models-3d.md` (path-scoped, loads when you touch the matching files); this file keeps the reasoning and the incident history behind it. Update both when a rule changes.

### 3D Model Library (marketplace)

A community 3D-printable parts library with a Stripe Connect marketplace. Backend lives in
`classicminidiy-supabase` (migrations `20260611*`, edge functions, RLS). Keystone contract:
`classicminidiy-supabase/docs/plans/2026-06-11-3d-model-library.md`. Built on the long-lived
`feature/3d-models` branch (no `modelsEnabled` flag — "launch" = merge to main).

**Load-bearing contracts:**

- **Supabase session is in localStorage, not a cookie.** Any `/api/*` route that needs the
  user must receive an explicit `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` header (get it from
  `supabase.auth.getSession()`). Direct `useSupabase()` → PostgREST/RPC calls are auto-authed
  and need no Bearer.
- **Payments are thin web proxies → edge functions.** `POST /api/models/[id]/checkout`,
  `/verify-purchase`, and `/api/models/seller/onboard` forward the Bearer token to
  `create-model-checkout` / `verify-model-purchase` / `create-seller-onboarding`. The web
  never calls Stripe directly. Redirect URLs are built from the browser origin and validated
  by the edge functions' allowlist (localhost is allowed for dev).
- **Stripe Connect (model sales) is separate from membership Stripe.** Direct charges on the
  seller's Standard connected account + platform commission via `application_fee_amount`;
  metadata `cmdiy_kind` starts `model_`. Its webhook endpoint + `STRIPE_CONNECT_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  are distinct from the membership webhook. Do not conflate with the `$1.99/mo` membership.
- **Entitlement is the download gate.** `has_model_entitlement(model_id)` RPC: free/tips and
  owner/admin always true; paid needs a purchase row; `removed`/`flagged` revokes everyone.
  The download route (`/api/models/[modelId]/files/[fileId]/download`) enforces it server-side;
  the detail page reads the RPC client-side to choose download vs. PriceBox.
- **Admin moderation** (`/admin/models`): approve/reject call the `is_admin()`-guarded RPCs
  client-side (admin JWT). Report-resolution (takedown + reporter notification + audit) and
  the seller kill-switch are service-role routes under `server/api/admin/models/`.
- **Contribution management is unified under `/dashboard`** (tabbed: models, gear-configs,
  submissions, selling, purchases). `/models/mine` redirects to `/dashboard/models`.
- New web env: `S3_MODELS_BUCKET`, `S3_MODELS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_MODELS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
  (dedicated IAM user, separate bucket from static assets). Launch steps:
  `docs/runbooks/2026-06-12-model-library-launch-checklist.md`.
